        I have hopes in attending the Univerity of Alberta and taking the Industrial Design Course. I also have an interest in Landscaping Architecture, as well as normal architecture and building architecture.
        <br>
        I am planning on going to the University first, then I will attempt to take as many architecture classes in NAIT as I can.

        I like designing things and making art. I also have an interest in game-making, and I want to create mods in Minecraft.

        Ever since I started playing Roblox, I was always making plans for my builds and building them. Lots of people said they liked my designs, so I gained confidence in my skills. I am aware that I might not be able to apply these skills to real life, but I am willing to give it a try.
