        I have hopes in attending the Univerity of Alberta and taking the Industrial Design Course. I also have an interest in Landscaping Architecture, as well as normal architecture and building architecture.
        <br>
        I am planning on going to the University first, then I will attempt to take as many architecture classes in NAIT as I can.
